Search Path Used by Windows to Locate a DLL
-------------------------------------------

With both implicit and explicit linking, Windows first searches for
"known DLLs", such as Kernel32.dll and User32.dll. Windows then searches
for the DLL's in the following sequence:

- The directory where the executable module for the current process is located.
- The current directory.
- The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function retrieves the
  path of this directory.
- The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function retrieves the path
  of this directory.
- The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

Note

  The LIBPATH environment variable is not used.
