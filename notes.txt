* DPI Awareness Extras:

  Adds a "DPI awareness extended" column to the process tree which

    1. Shows additional info about DPI awareness
    2. Works for Windows versions before 8.1 (before GetProcessDpiAwareness was introduced)

  Flags

    Flags are shown in parenthesis after the awareness. They consists of a letter followed by a status which is one of

    "+" The flag is on
    "-" The flag is off
    "?" The status is unknown

    Currently the following flags are shown

    F The DPI awareness is forced by the system, may be due to compatibility settings or desktop-composition being disabled.

    Known limitations

    On Windows 8.1+ the DPI awareness of processes on other sessions/window stations (possibly even desktops) arealways shown as Unaware, this is due to a limitation of GetProcessDpiAwareness
