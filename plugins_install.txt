1. If You on system don't installed Debugging Tools for Windows (Debuggers And

2. Old plug-ins is not compatible on PH v3.0 and required update.

Search Path Used by Windows to Locate a DLL (source - MSDN)
-----------------------------------------------------------

With both implicit and explicit linking, Windows first searches for
"known DLLs", such as Kernel32.dll and User32.dll. Windows then searches
for the DLL's in the following sequence:

- The directory where the executable module for the current process is located.
- The current directory.
- The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function retrieves the
  path of this directory.
- The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function retrieves the path
  of this directory.
- The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

  The LIBPATH environment variable is not used.

NOTES!

All used plug-ins required update and rebuild use latest Process Hacker SDK.

Any old plug-ins are not compatible with new versions of Process Hacker, and
their use will lead to a crash of his completing the task.

Security Explorer plugin can cause crashes Process Hacker on Windows 10, so
the OS is recommended to disable it. If you are using Windows 8.x and you have
problems caused by plug-in Security Explorer, open the Hacker menu -> Plugins
…, locate the Security Explorer plug-ins list and click the Disabled button
and then to apply the changes in the settings restart Process Hacker.

Sandboxie support plug-in

You can also disable any other plug-in, but disable plug-ins is recommended
only if the plug-in is causing problems.

Terminator plugin is designed exclusively for the crash of the processes and
threads that can not be completed in the normal way, but you must remember
that the abnormal termination of the process (thread) treated their data is
not stored that can lead to unpredictable errors in the work of others beyond
their processes (threads ).
