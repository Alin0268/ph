Firewall Monitor Plugin

Currently, the Zip archive of the assembly includes two revisions of
FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll (English) - one FirewallMonitorPlugin.dl_ for
Windows 10 v1607 - v1803 and FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll for Windows 10 v1809
and newer. The need for two revisions of the plug-in is caused by the
peculiarities of the OS, so if you have Windows 10 v1809 and newer, then
FirewallMonitorPlugin.dl_ will not be loaded and it can be removed to save
disk space, if you have Windows 10 v1607 - v1803, then rename
FirewallMonitorPlugin.dl_ in FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll overwriting the
existing file and restart Process Hacker after which the plugin should work in
Windows 10 v1607 and newer.

If you use the installer processhacker-3.0-setup.exe version 3.0.7735.3208,
then it will install the necessary revision of the plugin itself, and if your
OS version is lower than Windows 10 v1607, then the plugin will not be
displayed in the list of components.

NOTES!

If FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll for Windows 10 v1607 - v1803 becomes incompatible
with the current version of Process Hacker, it will be removed without
warning!
