Firewall Monitor Plugin

Currently, the Zip archive of the assembly includes two different revisions of
Firewall Monitor Plugin (English): FirewallMonitorPlugin.dl_ for Windows 8.1 -
10 v1809 and FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll for Windows 10 v1903 and newer.

The needed different revisions of the plug-in is caused by the peculiarities
of the OS, but if you have Windows 10 v1809 and newer FirewallMonitorPlugin.dl_
will not be loaded and it can be removed to save disk space,

if you have Windows 8.1 - 10 v1809, then rename FirewallMonitorPlugin.dl_ in
FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll overwriting the existing file and restart Process
Hacker after which the plugin should work in Windows 10 v1607 and newer.

If you use the installer processhacker-3.0-setup.exe version 3.0.7735.3208,
then it will install the necessary revision of the plug-in itself, and if your
OS version is lower than Windows 8.1, then the plug-in will not be
displayed in the list of components.

NOTES!

If FirewallMonitorPlugin.dll for Windows 8.1 - 10 v1809 becomes incompatible
with the current version of Process Hacker, it will be removed without warning!
